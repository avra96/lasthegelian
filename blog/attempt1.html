<h1>Blog attempt 1</h1>
<p>I am trying to make a blog and do it myself. It is hard. I am sad at myself.
  A friend of mine helped me get the github and tought me the basics. Thanks to him. I stole the css from a blog (now down it seems) I used to like, I will email the author and give him due credit if he so wills. Eventually i hope to become competent enough to make my own css. The reason for the blog will be transparent soon. Apparently there is not enough cognitive litter on the internet yet and i have to put my own. the title of the blog is just to annoy the hegelbros paying dad’s money for their vanity MA degrees so they can put hegel’s picture on their pesonal twitter pages. I should be ashamed of how much spite motivates me but so it is, a sad attempt to shut down sad thoughts by producing another pound of cyberlitter. </p>
