<h1>Blog attempt 1</h1>
<p>I am trying to make a blog and do it myself. It is very hard and it looks like shit. I am sad at myself.
  A friend of mine helped me get the github. Thanks to him. I stole the css from a blog I used to like, I will email the author and give him due credit if he so wills. The reason for the blog will be transparent soon. Apparently there is not enough cognitive litter on the internet yet and i have to place my own. the title of the blog is just to annoy the hegelbros paying dad’s money for their vanity MA degrees so they can put hegel’s picture on their pesonal twitter pages. I should be ashamed of how much spite motivates me but so it is, the saddest attempt to feeds one's ego through yet another pound of cyberlitter. </p>
