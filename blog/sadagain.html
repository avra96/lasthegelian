<title> My sadness has no depth </title>
<p>
I used to think deep thoughts and be insightful when it came to self-reflection. I used to think there was an interesting or important dimension to uncover, or at least something beautiful like a poem or a novel or a memoir or a movie. I used to feel really moved by that sort of reflective deepness, I used to like reading things like that. It now seems silly, an aimless waste of cognitive energy. Not that my mind goes there organically anymore anyways. Now my sadness has no depth and it stays at the level of feeling and the same words over and over (“hate”, “die”, “stupid”, “ugly”, “bad”). Basic shapes of a barely conceptualized discomfort which rise to nothing. Even thinking about possible meaning to extract from the sadness seems exhausting.
