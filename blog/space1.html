  <p style='margin:0cm;text-align:justify;font-size:16px;font-family:"Mongolian Baiti";'>What is a space of reasons? Part 1. &nbsp;</p>
<p style='margin:0cm;text-align:justify;font-size:16px;font-family:"Mongolian Baiti";'>Hegel says in his lectures on logic:&nbsp;</p>
<p style='margin:0cm;text-align:justify;font-size:16px;font-family:"Mongolian Baiti";margin-left:35.4pt;'>Thinking does not arise alongside the mental activities of sensation, will, and so on, but is rather ever present within them and is all-embracing. Yet as a subject matter it is nonetheless difficult. Unlike botany, physics, or mineralogy, logic has nothing to do with sensory intuition. (&hellip;) But one is no more able to single out color in general in contrast to any singular color than to refer to the animal in general as opposed to referring to this dog or this elephant. The elephant in general, the dog in general, the species does not objectively exist. The genus is something still more general, which once again falls to me as subject. If I speak of cause and effect, saying for example &quot;The house is toppled by water,&quot; what I see by my senses is the water and afterwards the toppling of the house. Yet the determination of the one as cause and the other as effect is not a sensory determination, but is a determination belonging to me. Only the successive happenings in time are sensory. Careful inspection shows that, along with sensory objects and interwoven with them, logical forms arise that are quite alien to them, that are not sensory objects. Such forms have been as extensively classified as the species forms of plants and animals, and they moreover have been classified for themselves rather than for any external purpose. The complete classification of these forms is logic and, along with it, metaphysics.&rsquo; (1831, trans. Clark Butler, pp 2-3,)</p>
<p style='margin:0cm;text-align:justify;font-size:16px;font-family:"Mongolian Baiti";'>&nbsp;</p>
<p style='margin:0cm;text-align:justify;font-size:16px;font-family:"Mongolian Baiti";'>In Stephen Turner&rsquo;s critique of normativism as an approach to understanding human phenomena, one of his complaints against normativist forms of explanation relies on the &lsquo;construction by analogy&rsquo;:</p>
<p style='margin:0cm;text-align:justify;font-size:16px;font-family:"Mongolian Baiti";'>&nbsp;</p>
<p style='margin:0cm;text-align:justify;font-size:16px;font-family:"Mongolian Baiti";margin-left:35.4pt;'>There is [as a problem for normativism] the number of unusual devices necessary to sustain this argument: the problem of the construction of the facts themselves, which were made by analogies &ndash; rules which are not ordinary explicit rules, but tacit; spaces, for example, of reason, which were not spatial; presuppositions which are not, as in Euclid, actually presupposed, but were rather conditions for the possibility of the normative fact that are retrospectively constructed for the purpose of explain them, (&hellip;) (Turner 2010, p. 180)</p>
<p style='margin:0cm;text-align:justify;font-size:16px;font-family:"Mongolian Baiti";'>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style='margin:0cm;text-align:justify;font-size:16px;font-family:"Mongolian Baiti";'>I am interested specially in the critique of &lsquo;space of reasons&rsquo; as analogy. Is it an analogy? How would it work? How would it fail?&nbsp;</p>
<p style='margin:0cm;text-align:justify;font-size:16px;font-family:"Mongolian Baiti";text-indent:35.4pt;'>Hegel puts time and space in the philosophy of nature, not the philosophy of Geist. This is a key rupture with Kant&rsquo;s transcendental aesthetic. But does it mean that thinking (or &lsquo;pure thinking&rsquo;) is possible without the self-referential indexicality of the &lsquo;inner sense&rsquo;? Is it not a <em>necessary condition&nbsp;</em>for &lsquo;thinking&rsquo; to <em>take place&nbsp;</em>that <em>it must take place&nbsp;</em>for a subjective consciousness who undergoes thinking in time (as something like an inner intuition)? But &lsquo;being possible&rsquo; is part of the transcendental repertoire: for the immanent unfolding of pure thought-determinations, <em>the question of the conditions of possibility of thought&nbsp;</em>is &lsquo;always already&rsquo; a <em>product&nbsp;</em>of a logically prior determinateness. The I as subject which questions what must be in place for her to <em>start thinking&nbsp;</em>has already started thinking. Which in a way signals that the I as spatiotemporal<em>&nbsp;</em>location, the self as the necessary indexical for all thinking, is not the (logical) beginning of thinking, but rather an already articulated moment within it. Thought determines even before the appearance of the self-locating I realizes that she cannot be conscious without (something like) temporal synthesis.</p>
<p style='margin:0cm;text-align:justify;font-size:16px;font-family:"Mongolian Baiti";'>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;That&rsquo;s weird. If thinking is so non-subjective, if the subject is not the essence or material condition of thinking, how can we still call it <em>thinking</em>? How much can we (Hegel) separate thought from human beings with impressions and beliefs and opinions etc. without &lsquo;thinking&rsquo; losing its meaning and becoming only something like&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know&hellip; being? Maybe this helps: &lsquo;As human beings we are the activation of thinking. I am this very activation. Thinking expands by its inner instinctive tendency into everything objective. Yet at first we lack all awareness of thinking, it has not yet become an object for us.&rsquo; We think even when we are unaware of thought. That is because being a practical entity in the world requires <em>discernment&nbsp;</em>(other animals &ndash;maybe even everything alive&mdash;likewise discern to survive, respond adequately to reality as differentially presented to the senses), which, on the objective side, requires the manifold to be <em>differentiated in itself</em>. What this means is just the refutation of subjective idealism. (Not something we can get into here.) Geist is the activity which aims to respond <em>appropriately</em> to a differentiated world, and the property or adequacy involves <em>coincidence</em> &ndash;when immediate, the drive towards coincidence is neither an achievement nor an accident, but the <em>internal telos&nbsp;</em>of being a practical being. I don&rsquo;t think this is so controversial. Now, objective thinking is the product of <em>thinking thinking,&nbsp;</em>or the arising of self-determining thinking: of turning the categorization itself into an object of thought (A.W. Moore: making sense of making sense.) When practicality is supplemented with the understanding of the urge of adequacy, then we have spiritual agency; an agency mediated by the self-conscious nature of its own activity. (The activity + the consciousness of the adequacy searched by through the activity &ndash;self-consciously understood purpose).</p>
<p style='margin:0cm;text-align:justify;font-size:16px;font-family:"Mongolian Baiti";'>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Back to the &lsquo;space of reasons.&rsquo; Are we justified in talking about the <em>space&nbsp;</em>of reasons? An obvious response is that it should not be held against us to think and argue with spatial analogies (talking about the normative <em>sphere</em>, the <em>field&nbsp;</em>of inquiry, the <em>placement&nbsp;</em>problem, <em>levels&nbsp;</em>of reality, etc.). It is <em>useful</em>, it concretizes abstract arguments. Why? Because we know what being and moving in space is like &ndash;it gives us a reference frame. <em>Thinking&nbsp;</em>takes place. It takes place &lsquo;in&rsquo; the brain and it takes place for a subject with the appearance of spatiotemporal indexicality (&lsquo;<em>in</em>&rsquo; this room, right now). But, if we follow Hegel, thinkability (thought) does not &lsquo;take&rsquo; place. The <em>activation</em> of what is thinkable takes place, but thinkability does not depend, &lsquo;in itself&rsquo;, on its being activated. What normativist authors, according to Turner, mean when they talk about the space of reasons is <em>not&nbsp;</em>a mappable, actual space &ndash;and that is the core of his complaint. These authors muddle the water and hiding the unscientific nature of their explanations by mobilizing concepts which suggest concreteness where there is none. And maybe he is right, and maybe the analogy does more harm than good: becoming &lsquo;rational&rsquo; or whatever (undertaking commitments and expecting justifications etc.) is not like entering a place. Entering places usually is (a) ephemeral (you eventually leave) and, at least in my own terrible experience, (b) you often require invitations or permissions or to pay for a service or to consume something in order to legitimize being there. Is it ephemeral to be rational? I think normativist authors don&rsquo;t expect it to be a game that we play sometimes, but the game of games, the precondition for anything else to count as humanly intelligible in the first place. (For me <em>if it is, it is&nbsp;</em>ephemeral and nonessential for human intelligibility, but that&rsquo;s another matter). Ok, I&rsquo;ll continue later and consult the original context of the analogy in Sellars talking about the &lsquo;logical space of reasons&rsquo;. The hunch is that Hegel can help us understand that we don&rsquo;t need &lsquo;rationality&rsquo; (understood as either self-conscious thinking, or the practices which constitute what some authors take to be &lsquo;rationality&rsquo;) to be a space, or &lsquo;like&rsquo; a space, and maybe that the notion of a logical space is inadequate.&nbsp;</p>
