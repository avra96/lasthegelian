<p> [Some questions for Brandom&apos;s pragmatist inferentialism from a seminar paper I wrote.] </p>
<p style='margin-top: 0cm; margin-right: 0cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; font-size: 16px; font-family: "Mongolian Baiti"; text-indent: 35.4pt; line-height: 1;'><span style='font-family: "Lucida Console", Monaco, monospace; font-size: 14px;'>If Brandom&rsquo;s theory is the explanation of the phenomenon of <em>properly human&nbsp;</em>conceptual use, without in principle restricting itself to a determinate context of linguistic application, then either he assumes it constitutes an empirical truth that <em>all&nbsp;</em>human conceptual use employs such implicit normative structure, <em>or&nbsp;</em>Brandom stipulates so without attending to human practices which appear to contradict his picture. Remaining within the pragmatist thesis for use to determine content, the boundaries of a concept can be understood as being drawn by <em>purpose &ndash;</em>a pragmatic point defended by Ruth Garret Millikan. In this naturalistic version, this purpose corresponds to something like evolutionary fitness points or &lsquo;survival value&rsquo;.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span style="vertical-align:super;"><span style="vertical-align:super;">[1]</span></span></a> This manner of drawing conceptual boundaries requires minimal coherence and responsiveness to the environment.</span><span style='vertical-align: super; font-family: "Lucida Console", Monaco, monospace; font-size: 14px;'>&nbsp;<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span style="vertical-align:super;">[2]</span></a></span><span style='font-family: "Lucida Console", Monaco, monospace; font-size: 14px;'>&nbsp;Animals can clearly do this: the parrot might only utter the word &lsquo;red&rsquo; without grasping the meaning of the concept <u>red</u>, but, as animals, parrots move coherently within their world for the aims of survival and reproduction. We can in principle fathom the possibility of most human behavior to be accurately describable in these terms as well. People can be competent speakers and practical agents without any but the most practically fundamental conceptual content, because we can and do map the world in accordance to such instrumental practicality.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span style="vertical-align:super;"><span style="vertical-align:super;">[3]</span></span></a> This is not to claim that the conceptual boundaries are not drawn by relations of inference, but rather that the purposive principle that determines such boundaries is <em>not</em>, pragmatically, the normative idealized structure of the language game of GAAFR. Rather, it something close to the stimuli-response Brandom considers proper of non-linguistic animals.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style='margin: 0cm; text-align: justify; font-size: 16px; font-family: "Mongolian Baiti"; text-indent: 35.4pt; line-height: 1;'><span style='font-family: "Lucida Console", Monaco, monospace; font-size: 14px;'>Take me, for example. As I write this, I consider myself a competent user of the concept <u>octopus</u>. I can use it in sentences and draw conclusions as much as necessary in my daily life --which is close to null. Nothing but the most basic familiarity with different species of animals has determined the boundaries of my concept of <u>octopus</u>; given this lack of practical motivation, my competence with this concept is not but the bare minimum to <em>get by</em>. I encounter no practical <em>motivation&nbsp;</em>to draw these conceptual boundaries better (through, for example, researching information about octopuses, learning from experts, etc.). I have not yet nor will likely have any self-assumed practical motivation for &lsquo;taking responsibility&rsquo; of all the <em>implicit&nbsp;</em>commitments others can attribute to me given such lazily-determined concept of <u>octopus</u>. I have a very vague sense of the fact that octopuses are very special among animals. I have no idea why exactly. I can imagine living the rest of my life without ever taking any steps to &lsquo;earn&rsquo; my right to competently talk about octopuses in the space of reasons. Someone comes, say, and reports a fact about octopuses which might contradict an assumed feature. I can imagine myself responding &lsquo;that is interesting&rsquo; and never coming to examine that inconsistency, never being motivated to decide.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style='margin: 0cm; text-align: justify; font-size: 16px; font-family: "Mongolian Baiti"; text-indent: 35.4pt; line-height: 1;'><span style='font-family: "Lucida Console", Monaco, monospace; font-size: 14px;'>Let us take this one step further: I can imagine a life where most of my concepts are like <u>octopus</u>. This is a case showcasing the possibility of a human life lived through superficial concept determinacy. Critics of Brandom&rsquo;s inferentialist semantics often object to the strong demarcation between human and non-human animal minds: for some critics, animal minds should be given more credit.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span style="vertical-align:super;"><span style="vertical-align:super;">[4]</span></span></a> My objection goes the opposite way. That human beings, in some contexts (such as courts of law and philosophy classrooms), exhibit the commitment to discursive intelligibility through the self-conscious practices of demanding and expressing reasons, is uncontroversial enough. But it is in principle questionable that this structure consistently operates in human conceptual determinacy and linguistic exchanges in such a manner that we can authoritatively equate it with &lsquo;the downtown of language.&rsquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style='margin: 0cm; text-align: justify; font-size: 16px; font-family: "Mongolian Baiti"; text-indent: 35.4pt; line-height: 1;'><span style='font-family: "Lucida Console", Monaco, monospace; font-size: 14px;'>But let us also consider the skeptical case of practical refusal of the normativity of reason. What happens when a player actively refuses to abide by the norms which, according to Brandom, stand at the intelligible core of all language? We can imagine the following scenario: our friend makes the claim (1) &lsquo;Sally the cow is a sentient animal&rsquo; but refuses to endorse the further claim, which is entailed by the first, that (2) &lsquo;Sally the cow feels pain&rsquo;. We explain to her how inference works, and explain to her that she is obliged, by the content of the first assertion, to similarly endorse (2). Yet she refuses to endorse (2). What would the Brandomian reply? We could say that my friend is either not playing the game right or she is not playing the game at all. (A third avenue would be to claim that such cases are impossible: that she must be lying when she claims that she does not endorse (2). This would suggest that true &lsquo;illogical&rsquo; thinking is impossible. I will not consider this option here.) If we claim that she is not playing the game &lsquo;right&rsquo;, we can nevertheless still <em>make sense</em> of her practical &lsquo;being&rsquo;: she is still a human being. Our friend has certain practical motives and being consistent above and beyond the necessary minimum to accurately respond to external stimuli insofar as it suits her immediate interest is simply not a priority for her. Instrumentally, the consequences could be detrimental: since she has been proven not to be a reliable source of informational and logical consistency, the social penalties would indeed most likely follow.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span style="vertical-align:super;"><span style="vertical-align:super;">[5]</span></span></a> It is conceivable that she does not care about the penalties of the community. Just as people are not practically motivated by their contradicting commitments when there is no significant social pressure,<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span style="vertical-align:super;"><span style="vertical-align:super;">[6]</span></span></a> nor are those contradictions a source of particular distress, we can speculate she could not be moved either. A human being who is capable of engaging in everyday affairs through language, while not much bothered by her inconsistencies is conceivable; indeed, several research projects are predicated on the observation of the overwhelming predominance of these &lsquo;epistemically irresponsible&rsquo; human practices.<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span style="vertical-align:super;"><span style="vertical-align:super;">[7]</span></span></a>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style='margin: 0cm; text-align: justify; font-size: 16px; font-family: "Mongolian Baiti"; text-indent: 35.4pt; line-height: 1;'><span style='font-family: "Lucida Console", Monaco, monospace; font-size: 14px;'>It might be a useful to, as Brandom, bring forth the Wittgensteinian device of a &lsquo;language game&rsquo; to present a contrast. The notion is introduced in the <em>Philosophical Investigations</em>, where Wittgenstein describes how the meaning of words comes to be learned through their use in determinate activities and processes. The crucial insight is that the meaning of words is necessarily tied to their function. A language game (<em>Sprachspiel</em>) is the whole consisting of &lsquo;language and the activities into which it is woven&rsquo;.<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span style="vertical-align:super;"><span style="vertical-align:super;">[8]</span></span></a> My friend engages in the language game of &lsquo;chitchat&rsquo;: what is proper of the language-game of chitchat is that neither player is at all committed to the overall purpose of <em>reaching a true conclusion</em> or <em>convincing others</em>, but simply socially exchanging words. People talk about things without being committed to what they say, and others receive such statements without treating them as <em>judgements</em>. I suggest that it is not only conceivable that chitchat could be the house of language, but an equally suited candidate to rationally reconstruct or theoretically schematize what &lsquo;we&rsquo; actually do.<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span style="vertical-align:super;"><span style="vertical-align:super;">[9]</span></span></a> In this account, Brandom&rsquo;s theory applies to a very specific kind of language game: that where it is understood that the participants will be ready to <em>commit and justify</em> their utterances. It applies in the game of GAAFR, now understood (contra Brandom) as involving an explicit undertaking of the commitment of practical consistency, and thus the practitioner is willing to hold <em>herself&nbsp;</em>accountable. The GAAFR usually comes by in the contexts where we <em>predict&nbsp;</em>that our utterances will not be smoothly received (i.e., to be received by our interlocutor without any resistance; that our competence with a determinate concept will not be questioned. I will not question the marine biologists use of <u>octopus</u>, but her colleagues might. She can play chitchat about octopuses with me, but not with them). Chitchat can easily devolve into GAAFR: when a friendly interlocutor, with whom I am chitchatting, suddenly refuses to go along with a bad justification. The key point here is that, prior to an <em>explicit</em> commitment, one could interpret this exchange from the perspective of <em>two</em>, not <em>one,&nbsp;</em>different failures: either I am playing the language game of GAAFR wrong by not providing good reasons and accepting my commitments, <em>or</em> my friend is playing the game of chitchat wrong by demanding me to <em>think</em>, to <em>reflect upon my claims</em>, to provide a rationally <em>acceptable&nbsp;</em>justification. Who is right and who is wrong? If there is no commitment-independent normative bindingness, the answer seems to be &lsquo;no one&rsquo;. Prior to explicit acceptance of being motivated to fulfill the self-imposed<em>&nbsp;</em>obligation to be rational, there is no commitment to be rational. Brandom either accepts this conclusion or joins the ranks of the metaethicists attempting to supply a metaphysical grounding for mind-dependent norms.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style='margin: 0cm; text-align: justify; font-size: 16px; font-family: "Mongolian Baiti"; text-indent: 35.4pt; line-height: 1;'><span style='font-family: "Lucida Console", Monaco, monospace; font-size: 14px;'>If rationality constituted the essence of human communication, then successful linguistic exchanges without rationality would not be intelligible, much less a significant aspect of human concept-using life. But I hope my appeal to the ubiquity of chitchat shows that non-rationally-committed exchanges are not only conceivable but a central mode of sociality for our species. It is an empirical question how much self-reflective rationality is actually deployed in most human linguistic exchanges. It is a further methodological question what would be the proper path for measuring such deployment. The point remains that it is in principle possible to conceive of a pragmatically effective human life which (1) consists of pure chitchat; (2) when being pushed by others into the game of GAAFR, the practitioner does not find the inconsistency of her beliefs as a motivating factor to deploy mental resources to revise her concepts or change her behaviors. That is, she refuses to be dragged into the space of reasons. She claims not to see the inherent desirability of acting in accordance to rational accountability. Without the <em>explicitly undertaken&nbsp;</em>commitment to draw conceptual boundaries in accordance to truth as purpose, it is thinkable that I could have a competent human relation with the world where my concepts remain underdetermined. &nbsp;</span></p>

Dennett summarizes the point in the following terms: &lsquo;Here, I think, is where Brandom thinks there is a significant watershed: there is all the difference in the world, he thinks, between norms maintained by communities of norm-protecting language-users and norms maintained by the relatively blind processes of natural selection or operant conditioning and its kin. But here he must confront his own version of the regress problem: even if we assume that normal adults appreciate the moves in the game --recognizing the speech acts that honor, flout, exploit, defend, abandon the norms of the linguistic community--how did they get themselves into this savvy condition? How, in short, does linguistic correction bootstrap itself into existence?&rsquo; &nbsp;&lsquo;&lsquo;The Evolution of &lsquo;Why?,&rsquo;&rsquo;&rsquo; 55.</span></p>

The norms for language are uses that have had &lsquo;survival value&rsquo;, as Sellars put it. (&hellip;) Their status has nothing to do with anyone&rsquo;s assessments. A norm is merely a measure from which actual facts can depart; it need not be an evaluative measure. A mere average, after all, is also a kind of norm. Behavioral forms that have had past survival value are a measure from which actual behavioral dispositions, both past and present, can depart, but such departures are in no sense proscribed.&rsquo; Millikan, &lsquo;The Father, the Son, and the Daughter,&rsquo; 64&ndash;65.&nbsp;</span></p>

The sanction is that the community stops taking you seriously. Consider also: &lsquo;One can coherently interpret a community as engaging in practices in which performances are treated as having the significance of promises (or of the more primitive sort of nonlinguistic undertaking of task-responsibility, of which taking the queen&apos;s shilling is an example) even if the only sanction for failing to perform as one has committed oneself to do is to disqualify oneself from counting in the future as eligible to undertake such commitments. Some- thing like this is what happened to the boy who cried &lsquo;Wolf.&rsquo; I Having several times committed himself to the claim that a wolf was present (thereby licensing and indeed obliging others to draw various conclusions, both practical and theoretical) under circumstances in which he was not entitled by the evident presence of a wolf to undertake such a commitment and to exercise such authority, the boy was punished-his conduct practically acknowledged as inappropriate-by withdrawal of his franchise to have his performances treated as normatively significant.&rsquo; <em>Making It Explicit</em>, 179&ndash;80.&nbsp;</span></p>
