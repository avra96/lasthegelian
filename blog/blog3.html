<p> <p style='margin:0cm;text-align:justify;font-size:16px;font-family:"Mongolian Baiti";'><span style='font-family: "Courier New", courier;'><span style="font-size: 14px;">I am unable to focus on things because I don&rsquo;t see the point in them. Rarely do I value the things I do. When I do see some value in the things I do, any lack of external validation makes me doubt them. I hate what other people do. I would hate myself more if I did things in a more likely advantageous manner. I somehow think the sheer power of my conviction will get me to places because I do not want to put in the effort of &lsquo;making connections&rsquo; or adequating my work to how publishable people write and think and advance arguments. But I think this is probably just a form of explaining to myself the fact that nobody likes what I do. Because maybe the reason nobody likes what I do is that there is no value there. I have been receiving so many rejections lately. Being me is like being piece of shit with no anchor in reality and no moves to make in a game she barely understands but who nevertheless stubbornly clings to a clearly wrong way of doing things because doing them any other way would make her feel worse. I don&rsquo;t trust other people to tell me what&rsquo;s good but I don&rsquo;t trust myself either, because what do I fucking know. I just wish somebody objectively explained to me &lsquo;how things are done&rsquo; and why I am so bad at it, at everything. Even then I would not have the energy to change, but at least I&rsquo;d have some certainty.</span> </span></p>
